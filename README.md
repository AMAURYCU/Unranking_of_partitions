# Unranking of partitions

This project is accompaning the paper Lexicographic unranking algorithms for the Twentyfold Way (https://cnrs.hal.science/LIP6/hal-05486059v1). 
It provides implementations of a lexicographic unranking algorithm for the problems of the Twentyfold Way linked to set partitions. 
This project is constitued of one folder per problem, each containing 5 python files: 
- `combinatorial.py` contains the unranking algorithm for the order induced by the combinatorial interpretation of the counting formula for the problem.
- `lexicographic.py` contains the unranking algorithm for the lexicographic order as defined in the paper and coded in the file `lex_order.py`. 
- `example.py` contains an example of use of use of unranking algorithms for random generation and exhaustive generation of the objects of the problem.
- `test.py` contains exhaustive tests of the unranking algorithms for small values of the parameters of the problem.
